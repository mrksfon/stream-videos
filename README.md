Learning React

I order to start project you should 

navigate to project client and run <b>npm start</b> <br/>
navigate to project api and run <b>npm start</b> <br/>
navigate to project rtmpserver and run <b>npm start</b> from your terminal <br/>

To see streaming video you must have some kind of software for broadcasting video <br/>
in my case I used OBS . Setup service as custom . Server is : <br>rtmp://localhost/live</b> .</br>
Stream key is the id of stream you created for example and adress localhost:3000/streams/2 <br/>
the Stream key would be the same as id in our case 2.

# stream-videos
Learning React

I order to start project you should 

navigate to project client and run npm start
navigate to project api and run npm start
navigate to project rtmpserver and run npm start from your terminal

To see streaming video you must have some kind of software for broadcasting video
in my case I used OBS . Setup service as custom . Server is : rtmp://localhost/live .
Stream key is the id of stream you created .
